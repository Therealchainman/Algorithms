Simulate the fire directly, simulate how the fire spreads
for a square comptue

loop through all squares 
Do a BFS through the grid
Top left or bottom right square is reachable
Do a traversal through the grid


pop k elements from m stacks


do reorder initially, and fix it a specific part of rows
then you know what operations, 
perform those operations and check if they can be reordered to be the same.
